# To Do list:
## What I would like to do:   
* add a GUI using `tkinter` to make it more easily usable even for non-command-line users. 
* add the multicore mode the program talks about on every start...   
## What has to be done:
* Enable the updater to check if the version online (if unequal) is higher or lower and ask the user if they really want to downgrade if the download is a downgrade.
## What I will probably never manage to do myself/on my own (what I might need help with):
* Nothing yet
