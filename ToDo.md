# To Do list:
## What I would like to do:   
* add a GUI using `tkinter` (or better PyGTK, because of better theme integration) to make it more easily usable even for non-command-line users.  
## What has to be done:
* Enable the updater to check if the version online (if unequal) is higher or lower and ask the user if they really want to downgrade if the download is a downgrade.
* Change main `while` loop to:
```python3
for i in range(0, cycles_max):
    ... # Maybe a print for the current progress.
```
<!--* -->
## What I will probably never manage to do myself/on my own (what I might need help with):
* Nothing yet
