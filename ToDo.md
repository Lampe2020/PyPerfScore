# To Do list:
## What I would like to do:   
* add a GUI using `tkinter` to make it more easily usable even for non-command-line users. 
* add the multicore mode the program talks about on every start...   
## What has to be done:
* Enable the updater to automatically get directories from files.list (must be added to dirs.list as entries (maybe with a `/` at the end?)) and create those automatically.
## What I will probably never manage to do myself/on my own (what I might need help with):
* Nothing yet
